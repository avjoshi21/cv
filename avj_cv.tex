% \section*{Research Overview}
% I am a computational astrophysicist working on accretion onto supermassive black holes, with a focus on radiative processes that are observationally relevant. This involves applying radiative transfer methods to magnetohydrodynamic models within the context of general relativity. Other topics I am interested in are magnetohydrodynamics, numerical relativity and astrophysical plasmas in general. %I use both high-performance computing (HPC) and high-throughput computing (HTC) methods to generate simulations and compare them to observations for model inference.

\section*{Research Interests}
Supermassive black hole accretion, general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT), general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD), numerical relativity, astrophysical plasmas, High-Performance Computing (HPC), High-Throughput Computing (HTC)
